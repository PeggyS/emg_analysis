Chalard A, Belle M, Montan√© E, Marque P, Amarantini D, Gasq D. Impact of the EMG normalization method on muscle activation and the antagonist-agonist co-contraction index during active elbow extension: Practical implications for post-stroke subjects. Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology. 2020;51:102403. doi:10.1016/j.jelekin.2020.102403
	- ref recorded EMG data at 1 kHz
	- preprocessing: raw emg band pass filtered 10-400 Hz, full wave rectified, smoothed at 9 Hz to create linear envelope
		- all filters: 4th order zero-lag Buttworth
	- kinematic data lp filtered at 6 Hz
	- onset and offset of movement: threshold of 0.01 deg/s - elbow angular velocity
	- isometric MVC = RMS value of linear envelope over 2-s window (recorded 5 s contraction)


- our data (c2799tdvg) 
	- recorded at 2.5 kHz
	- same filtering to compute envelope
	- 1 s window (RMS) for isometric MVC


MVC analysis: mvc.mlapp
	- reads in Brainvision Recorder (.vhdr) file
	- displays bicep & tricep hp filtered data and emg linear envelope
	- adds (draggable) patches at the mvc events
	- saves the rms value in the mvc window to a file
		- file: .../analysis/emg/<subject>/<session>/<muscle>_mvcs.txt

	todo:
		- add deletion and addition of mvc patches

Co-contraction analysis: cocontraction.mlapp
	- reads in Brainvision Recorder (.vhdr) file
	- displays bicep & tricep hp filtered data and emg linear envelope
	- gets mvc data
	- normalizes linear envelope by (mean or max) of mvc value

	- co-contraction index using Falconer and Winter, 1985 formula:
		CCI =  2 * (emg flexors) /( emg flexors + emg extensors) * 100%
