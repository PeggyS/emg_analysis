Chalard A, Belle M, Montan√© E, Marque P, Amarantini D, Gasq D. Impact of the EMG normalization method on muscle activation and the antagonist-agonist co-contraction index during active elbow extension: Practical implications for post-stroke subjects. Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology. 2020;51:102403. doi:10.1016/j.jelekin.2020.102403
	- ref recorded EMG data at 1 kHz
	- preprocessing: raw emg band pass filtered 10-400 Hz, full wave rectified, smoothed at 9 Hz to create linear envelope
		- all filters: 4th order zero-lag Buttworth
	- kinematic data lp filtered at 6 Hz
	- onset and offset of movement: threshold of 0.01 deg/s - elbow angular velocity
	- isometric MVC = RMS value of linear envelope over 2-s window (recorded 5 s contraction)


- our data (c2799tdvg) 
	- recorded at 2.5 kHz
	- same filtering to compute envelope
	- 1 s window (RMS) for isometric MVC


MVC analysis: mvc.mlapp
	- reads in Brainvision Recorder (.vhdr) file
	- displays bicep & tricep hp filtered data and emg linear envelope (10-400 Hz, rectified, 9 Hz lp filt, 4th order zero-lag butterworth)
	- adds (draggable) patches at the mvc events
	- saves the rms value in the mvc window to a file
		- file: .../analysis/emg/<subject>/<session>/<muscle>_mvcs.txt
	- extract the 'resting' emg level - use 1 s window with lowest mean value of linear envelope. Right-click near low emg area and the app will look in a 10 s window around that click for the lowest 1 s interval of emg.
		- when Save MVCs button is clicked the resting emg files are also saved: .../analysis/emg/<subject>/<session>/<muscle>_resting_emg.txt

	todo:
		- add reading in and display of previous resting emg info
		- add deletion and addition of mvc patches
		

Co-contraction analysis: cocontraction.mlapp
	- reads in Brainvision Recorder (.vhdr) file
	- displays bicep & tricep hp filtered data and emg linear envelope
	- gets mvc data
	- normalizes linear envelope by resting emg and mean of mvc values. Compute emg envelope same as mvc, subtract resting emg level (ref for this: Sarcher 2017 paper on CP children who would have some background emg level even when in the most relaxed muscle state), then scale by *maximum* mvc minus resting emg * 100. Envelope value should be between 0 and 100, but I've seen some values over 100 which means we did not get the Maximum mvc
	- need to make sure we are getting good mvc data.
	- Export info: 
		- saved in .../myopro merit/analysis/emg/<subject>/<session>/<eeg file prefix>_<exp type (bend|extend)>_cocontraction_info.txt
		- contains info about each movement and auc for the 2 muscles and ratio between the 2


	- todo:
		- read in previous analysis cocontraction_info.txt
		- add provision in compute_cocontraction_from_patches.m for bend-extend experiments (see FIXME)

	- Elbow angle data from Vicon:
		- reconstruct & label trial in Vicon Nexus
		- run static BodyLanguage on static trial
		- run dynamic BodyLanguage Model on movement trial
		- export ascii
			- Model outputs only - Selected - make sure to select the Angle outputs in the Model Output list
		- copy .csv file to: .../myopro_merit/data/vicon-kinematics/<subject>/<session>/
		- sync using GoodySync, vicon myopro merit job
		- file is read into matlab with 'read_vicon_model_trajectories_csv.m'
